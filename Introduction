Introduction
I'm a recent graduate from UC San Diego with a bachelors degree in General Biology. In my past time, I like to surf the web for almost anything and everything. Technology has always intrigured but I never thought that I had an interest to pursue a career. I have a very problem-solving mind and creative design mind. So what other better way to use these skills than to stay up-to-date with today's technology. I hope to use my spare time to acquire skills in technology and keep myself updated.
